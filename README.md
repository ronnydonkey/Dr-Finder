# 🩺 Dr Finder

**Dr Finder** helps people find the best local doctors that actually accept their insurance — backed by real reviews, not ads.

---

## ✅ What It Does

- Takes your **insurance plan**, **ZIP code**, and **doctor specialty**
- Cross-checks multiple review sources (Yelp, Google, Healthgrades, Reddit)
- Filters for real insurance coverage (or flags when uncertain)
- Returns the **top 3 doctors** near you with clear review highlights and standout traits

---

## 🚀 Why It Exists

Finding a doctor is frustrating:
- Insurance directories are messy and out-of-date.
- “In-network” doesn’t always mean accepted.
- Reviews are scattered across sites.

**Dr Finder** makes this clear, honest, and easy.

## ⚙️ How It Works

**Stack:**
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui + Radix UI** for accessible, modern components
- **Vercel Serverless API** for doctor matching (mock data for MVP)
